# Flustered - Embodied Labs

Hello,
My name is Chad Steele. I'm thrilled to learn about your important work.

This is my friend Chris. He's been stimming for over 30 years.
According to him, he has to keep tapping his chest and face in order to stay focused on "this" reality.
His fear is that if he misses a beat, he'll get lost in another reality, and have a hard time getting back to this one.

According to him. Severely autistic kids like him that end up drooling in the corner for eternity are lost and cannot tap back in. It's his greatest fear.

He's a poet and makes t shirts

He uses a touch screen to tap out words. I created this simple simulation to give you the experience of tapping into the reality you want. In this case, I challenge you to learn how to bake a cake.
