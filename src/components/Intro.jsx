        <p>Hello,</p>
        <p>My name is Chad Steele. I'm thrilled to learn about your important work and am excited about the difference you're making and the empathy you're teaching.  I want to help!</p>

        <p>This is my friend Chris.  I met him when he was 15.  I was a volunteer facilitator with "play for peace".   He's been stimming for 24/7 non stop for over 30 years.</p>
        <p>He says he has to keep tapping his chest and face in order to stay focused on "this" reality.  He told me to imagine trying to watch a movie when someone else keeps flipping the channels.  You have to learn to ignore the other channels and try to piece together the movie even though you only get to watch 1 out of every 10 seconds.</p>
        <p>His greatest fear is that if he misses a beat, he'll get lost in another reality, and have a hard time getting back to this one.  According to him, other severely autistic kids that end up drooling in the corner are lost for eternity and cannot tap back in. Imagine living everyday with this fear.</p>
        <p>He's a poet and makes t shirts  <a href="https://www.lopsidedheartcreations.com/" target="lopsided">lopsided heart creations</a></p>
        <p>He can't talk.  He uses a touch screen to tap out words. I created this simple simulation to give you the experience of tapping into the reality you want. </p>
        <p>I challenge you to learn how to bake a cake. </p>
        <p>Tap to start the experience Chris lives with all day every day.  Don't miss a beat, you may not make it back.  Keep tapping to focus on the Cake!</p>
        <p>Please ensure you turn your volume up</p>
